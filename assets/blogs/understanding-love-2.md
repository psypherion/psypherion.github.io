_yeah yeah ik a bit late …almost 2 weeks after the first blog in this series but then again wanting to learn everything all at once sucks and that’s why I’m busy as hell (not really). Reason why I am late -> I wrote this whole blog a while back and after going through the content I didn’t feel like posting so………..there’s that. Anyway let’s jump in…_

Love is often portrayed as the ultimate bliss, a never-ending fairy tale where two souls come together in perfect harmony. It’s the driving force behind countless songs, poems, and even the occasional war. But what if the way we think about love is actually setting us up for disappointment?

### **Unrealistic Expectations: The Startup Fallacy**

Imagine love as a startup company. Filled with high hopes and fueled by passionate investment, it promises exponential growth and a happily ever after. However, just like many startups, the reality of romantic love often falls short of the initial hype. We enter relationships with unrealistic expectations, fueled by fairytales, song, literature, Bollywood/Hollywood movies. When the inevitable fights, boredom, and compromises arise, disappointment sets in. And behind all that lies the true villain : “**Romanticism**”.

### How romanticism ruined love :

*   **The myth of the soulmate and effortless love:** Romanticism promotes the idea that there’s one perfect soulmate for everyone, and that love should feel effortless and intuitive. This sets people up for disappointment because it ignores the fact that relationships take work and compromise.
*   **Constantly being perfect :** Romantic love creates the unrealistic expectation that couples should have to be (constantly) a perfect lover all the time, and that a lack thereof is a sign of trouble in the relationship. This puts undue pressure on couples and can lead to anxiety and dissatisfaction.
*   **Unrealistic understanding and acceptance:** The belief that true love requires complete understanding and acceptance, and that partners should never have to change or compromise is another unrealistic expectation of Romanticism. People are complex and grow over time, so expecting perfect compatibility is a recipe for disappointment.

### **Romantic Love**

The [Romanticism movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism) was a major shift in artistic and intellectual thought that occurred in Western Europe between the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It emphasized emotion, imagination, and individual creativity, and a reverence for nature.

*   **A rejection of reason and a celebration of emotion:** Romanticism arose as a reaction to the Enlightenment, a philosophical movement that emphasized reason and logic. Romantics believed that reason had led to a cold and sterile view of the world, and they valued emotion, intuition, and imagination.
*   **Nature as a source of inspiration:** The Romantics saw nature as a source of beauty, power, and inspiration. They believed that spending time in nature could help people reconnect with their emotions and their true selves.
*   **Individualism and the cult of the hero:** Romanticism placed a high value on the individual and their unique experiences. The Romantic hero was a passionate and rebellious figure who defied social conventions.
*   **The birth of modern romantic love:** The Romantics are credited with creating the modern idea of romantic love. They believed that love was a powerful force that could transform people’s lives. They also believed that love was a source of great happiness and fulfillment.

The Romantics’ view of love had a profound impact on Western culture. It led to the development of new genres of literature, such as the Romantic novel, and it continues to influence our ideas about love today. Before this, marriage was primarily a practical arrangement for sharing resources and raising children, rather than a union based on love.

Romantic love comes with a set of unrealistic expectations. We believe we should find one person who will be our perfect match, our soulmate, who will make us perfectly happy forever. This quest for the “happily ever after” often leads to disappointment and heartbreak. Moreover, romantic love can be unstable; the initial passion often fades, leading to issues like boredom and resentment.

### **Exploring Romantic Love:**

**Historical Context and Unrealistic Ideals:** The idealized notions of romantic love, popularized during the Romanticism movement in the 18th century, can be harmful and unrealistic. Before this, love was often seen as a practical arrangement for sharing resources and having children. Romantic love, with its added expectations, is a relatively new and problematic development.

**Romantic Love and Religion: R**omantic love and religion are interconnected. Romantic love can feel extraordinary and divine, similar to faith. However, this creates problems as it’s impossible to idealize another person as one can with a deity. As the woman/man can never be an ideal person no matter how much you keep on idealizing he/she is infact still is a human being with flaws and therefore destined to disappoint if we make a idealized version of them in our mind. And also the concept of romantic ecstasy is not sustainable at all in the long term.

**Limerence and the Search for Perfection:** The term “limerence,” coined by psychologist [Dorothy Tennov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Tennov), describes an obsessive, unrequited crush. This aligns with romantic ideals of finding a perfect partner who fulfills all our needs, which is unrealistic and can lead to perpetual disappointment.

**Romanticism and Self-Narrative:** Sociologist [Anthony Giddens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Giddens) argues that romanticism, despite its negative aspects, is essential for forming healthy relationships by allowing individuals to develop a reflexively ordered narrative of the self. This perspective sees ordinary life as a hero’s journey, with pure relationships focusing on mutual respect and understanding rather than perfect compatibility.

### Pure Relationship (according to Anthony Giddens) :

*   In a pure relationship, the focus is on the quality of the relationship itself rather than the person you are with. Romantic love is all about the story, the fantasy, and the idea of happily ever after. A pure relationship is based on the lived experience of loving someone and the desire to be together.
*   Romantic love has expectations and prescribed roles. A pure relationship is flexible and up to the couple to decide what works for them. There are no gender roles or societal pressures.

### The Priest from Fleabag

In the show Fleabag, the priest delivers an unconventional wedding speech that offers a different, more nuanced perspective on love. He acknowledges that love can be frightening and difficult, making people doubt and judge themselves. Love can make individuals obsessed with their appearance, selfish, and even cruel. However, that finding love requires strength and hope.
