> So there I was, diving into the world of Deep Learning, drowning in research papers left and right, and I thought to myself, “Wouldn’t it be great if there was some system that could do all this tedious downloading and recommending for me?” And so, in my infinite wisdom (or perhaps laziness), I decided to embark on the journey of creating such a tool. It’s still a baby tho :3
