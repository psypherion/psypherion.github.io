> You got me! Typing those `git` commands is a total drag, especially when you're on a coding roll. So, I, like any self-respecting lazy coder, decided to automate that mess! My script might be a bit rough around the edges, but hey, it works for now! Let's tweak it together and make those commits smoother than butter.
