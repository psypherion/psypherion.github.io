### I do not believe in anything.

Since I was a child, I had trouble believing in anything out of the box I needed reasons, but growing up in a conservative family always made me feel like this was wrong. As I grew older, I shaped myself so that this issue no longer bothered me.

Once I spent a whole day debating with the head of an ashram about the topic of believing in “God” or higher powers. The very last thing he said to me was, “তুমি যদি একজন রিকশাওয়ালা কে যে সারাদিন খাটা খাটনি করে এসেছে তাকে বোঝাতে যাও ভগবান আসলে exist করে কিনা তাকে তুমি যদি বলো question করতে, তোমার কি মনে হয় সেটা কি সে করবে?”

This roughly translates to: “If you ask someone who has done laborious chores throughout his day to question the existence of God, what do you think would happen?”

This, along with what Nietzsche wrote in his “Anti-Christ” at the very beginning, made a huge impact on me. Just a few moments ago, when I saw a [_reel_](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9fULHwN4aW/?igsh=MXMwa3YyYWc3cXlxZw%3D%3D) posted by one of my following accounts about Osho saying “I do not believe in anything….,” it gave me the urge to jot this down as a rant.

> Pondering existential questions is a luxury that those engaged in daily survival don’t have. (And also people with less IQ, cognitive abilities, life experience, or education ig.)

Existential pondering, though more accessible to some, is a human pursuit that should transcend socio-economic and intellectual boundaries. But it’s highly unlikely.

Before ranting about stuff, I should mention that, in my personal opinion, people like Osho do not deserve any kind of respect or consideration as someone respected (well, I have my reasons for that).

In the [_reel_](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9fULHwN4aW/?igsh=MXMwa3YyYWc3cXlxZw%3D%3D), Osho mentioned “religious inquiry based on science.” What I think about this is : it won’t ever happen. It won’t be promoted by the higher authorities of religion (heck, even politicians) and the reason behind this is very simple: it won’t fit well with their business model because faith and dogma are deeply needed for their business.

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*6MVlXXrNfB_TmT1qbHHADw.png)

Religions and cults (Osho comes under this) will either completely deny any kind of scientific queries that go against their beliefs, saying we can’t and shouldn’t question something that is “beyond our understanding” (although they won’t hesitate for a moment to use science to prove even a single bit of information that can be used to somehow justify a fraction of their views)

Or,

Like Osho, they’ll vaguely promote such ideas but in reality will follow none of it or very little of it, resulting in no significant impact. Thus creating another troubled version of religious stupidity.

But yeah, people should question stuff as much as possible, but one must remember“To know is to suffer” (I don’t know who said itor if it’s just my own thought). Therefore, questioning pre-established notions (no matter how ridiculous they may seem) isn’t for everyone, and a large number of people will always need a larger-than-life purpose, be it devotion to God or loving someone which redirects to “God” / “Guru” or a romantic partner. Hence, the nuisance will never cease to exist.

The more I watch current social media trends, the more I find an expected, funny yet sad pattern. The “Red Pilled,” “Black Pilled,” alpha male, sigma male — at least most of them are highly promoting “Religion,” be it Christianity, Islam, Sanatan, etc. There is a positive correlation, and it’s SAD. This trend underscores religion's enduring appeal as a source of comfort, order, and community amidst the complexities of modern life.

**My note:**

For me, complexities in life are what bring beauty to life. Maybe it’s my privileged ass writing this shit, but yeah, “believing” in something just to feel happy and secure is not for me.
