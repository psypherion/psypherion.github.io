or, **Is God full of shit?**

Decided to rant about a few things that have been scratching my mind lately.

As we look into the teachings of prophets of Abrahamic Religion like Christianity & Islam i.e, Jesus Christ, Muhammad

If we carefully read the scriptures with a little bit of rationality and not taking everything as the ultimate thing, we could find several issues with their teachings.

And with the rise of so-called red-pilled “Alpha” and “Sigma” males, some popular, affluent figures — or influencers, at least quite a few prominent ones — are embracing religions to their fullest (mostly for the wrong reasons) without any questioning (logically, of course). From that perspective, I’ve always been amused by this, and I’ve already talked about it in one of my posts.

Some are converting to Islam and some following and being vocal about accepting christianity in some hard and fast fashion.

That being said, this is why I chose only these two religions. OFC I should mention there are issues with other religions too.

And as someone who considers himself an atheist (I must add that anyone accustomed to modern scientific thinking can never be a theist) and was brought up in a “Hindu” household, as much as I’ve read in the Vedas, the Gita, and the works of Vivekananda, “Hinduism” never really seemed to me like a religion in the usual sense. I could go on and on about this topic; maybe I’ll discuss my views on it later in another post.But for now let’s address this,

Let’s point out the issues that bothered me and a lot of others with rational thinking.

**1. Muhammad’s Marriage to Aisha**

One of the most controversial aspects of Muhammad’s life is his marriage to Aisha, who was significantly younger (6 yr) at the time of their union. Critics argue that this relationship reflects societal norms of the time rather than an example of divine wisdom. If Muhammad was indeed a messenger of God, how could such a union be justified in a contemporary context?

**2. Banu Qurayzu Execution**

The execution of the Banu Qurayzu tribe following the Battle of the Trench raises further questions. Muhammad’s decision to execute the tribe’s men and enslave the women and children is often defended as a tactical military decision. However, this raises ethical dilemmas regarding mercy, justice, and the role of a prophet as a moral exemplar. If a divine being guided Muhammad, why would such actions be tolerated?

**3. Islamic Apostasy
**The issue of apostasy in Islam presents another challenge. In many interpretations, leaving the faith can lead to severe consequences, including death. This seems contradictory to the principles of free will and the compassionate nature that many believers ascribe to God. If God is indeed all-knowing and all-powerful, why would such punitive measures be necessary?

**4. Jesus’s Views on Slavery
**Similarly, the New Testament contains passages that, at best, seem to condone slavery. Jesus did not explicitly denounce the institution, leading to the troubling interpretation that his teachings can be used to justify inhumane practices. This raises the question: if Jesus is a messenger of divine wisdom, why did he not advocate for the fundamental human rights we now consider essential?

**5. Jesus’s Interaction with the Canaanite Woman
**In the story of the Canaanite woman, Jesus initially rebuffs her plea for help, suggesting that his mission is only for the Jews. This interaction can be interpreted as exclusionary, raising doubts about the universality of his message. If Jesus was the embodiment of divine wisdom, why would he display such prejudice?

It is almost comical-if not tragic-that even a child can see through the hypocrisy in these teachings.

If the prophets were really, I mean really prophets of god, sent to earth to actually do some good. Then why do examples like these exist?

Now imagine this: God is supposed to be an omnipresent, omnipotent, all-knowing being — then why would any sensible, all-powerful being want or do such things?

Okay, if not, let’s just think of the prophets as maybe some enlightened ones, and through their enlightenment, they adhered to this knowledge which they endorsed as their teachings. Again, the same arguments hold.

Or, some scholars suggest it’s because of their societal norms. And if they were susceptible to societal norms, who gave them the authority to present themselves as someone sent by gods? On top of that, how can we find their “God’s words” or teachings so problematic? Why wouldn’t an omnipresent being’s words or ideas stand the test of time? _xd_ — you get the point.

From what I could find, most theistic believers arguements there are two types of theists:

1.  Those who still hold these beliefs hard and fast,
2.  And others who propose a workaround, saying it’s just because of the times they lived in and their societal issues.

These people think that’s a good enough answer.

BUT BUT BUUUUUUUUUUTTTTTT

If their great teachings are supposed to be given by the Almighty God, who knows everything, then how do these teachings create issues now? Why were those teachings susceptible to societal norms in the first place, and how much of their content is actually conformed to the norms of that time?

As society has changed, if we’re to follow these teachings, how should we decide which parts are relevant and which aren’t — especially since some of them seem quite hypocritical. Certain people with radical ideologies even exploit these inconsistencies to justify or motivate mayhem, like Boko Haram and ISIS.

But why do people cling to such doctrines, sometimes to extreme levels?

I am not a psychologist but,

As my common sense says, we don’t just believe because something’s true; we believe because it makes life easier. The truth can be uncomfortable — sometimes brutal. Most people would rather lean on a comforting lie than risk the alienation that comes with questioning everything they’ve been told. Plus, many religious traditions discourage inquiry outright, claiming some things are beyond our “human understanding.” Convenient, right?

That’s why you see people defending ideas that, under a little scrutiny, fall apart. People don’t question because questioning hurts. For some, religion is a shield against the void, a prepackaged answer to the questions they’re too scared to face. And let’s be real, it’s not just religion — this happens with any ideology that demands loyalty over truth.

After all, the answer to the glaring question in the title may lie in a synthesis of these views — where instead of considering them wholly as the messengers of divine wisdom, maybe it’s time we see them as flawed humans bound by their cultures (dare I say a bit delusional even). They weren’t infallible; they were people with limitations, biases, and, honestly, sometimes misguided actions. If there’s a takeaway here, it’s that you don’t have to buy into any belief just because it’s popular, traditional, or comforting. Find your own truth, whatever that looks like, and don’t settle for someone else’s version of enlightenment.

hehe :p
