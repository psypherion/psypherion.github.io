Faith, Lies, and the Struggle for Meaning

I just finished watching Heretic, & it was quite a good ride maybe a bit fascinating and introspective too. Like the other A24 movies that I watched it stayed true it’s signature style. It being a horror movie I was hoping for some maybe supernatural elements maybe a bit goric too but it wasn’t. Maybe for a general movie goer it may seem as a bit of yap fest. But the beauty of Heretic lies in those yapping. Unlike most other horror flicks Heretic delves deep into complex topics like religion, faith and ofc stupidity/gullibility of people but with a sadistic psychological twist that unlike other a24 horror projects (The Witch, Talk to me) is grounded in reality.

Manipulation through faith
--------------------------

The general idea of the movie revolves around how people let themselves be manipulated by doctrines, so called miracles and especially by the salesmen of religion. Mr.reed played by Hugh Grant brings out a huge point on religion being an iterative fabrication — a repackaging of same old stories over and over again over generations. He relates religion to monopoly which itself is an adaptation of an far older game called landlord. Just like Monopoly spun off from its predecessor, he argues, religions like Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and Mormonism are successive re imaginings of an original framework.

> Why is the original less popular than the iteration? Is it any less true than the others? …. **It has the fewest member because it doesn’t advertise.**

Therefore `faith` which often can be seen as something deeply personal and maybe a bit sacred aspect of our life, becomes nothing but a product which is designed, marketed and sold to suit the needs of those in power. And only reason it’s possible is because `belief` isn’t rooted in object truth.

Faith as a Comfort Mechanism
----------------------------

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1294/format:webp/1*L1W2ecFANk8n9dfF1t0qGg.png)

Rather it stems from an inherent human desire for comfort and security amidst life’s uncertainty. It’s not truth that people crave, but reassurance that tells people their lives have meaning, purpose, their struggles ain’t gonna be unnoticed and some higher power is watching over them who is righteous, benevolent and omnipotent.

This is exactly why religion, being an excellent business model has thrived for centuries. The success of religion lies in human vulnerability, gullibility. And the people behind religions understood this fact very well and exploited successfully using faith as a means to control over rest of the people.

Therefore `faith` becomes less about divinity and more about dependency on something external to give life meaning, even if it’s a construct born out of collective fragile human insecurity. And when belief is stripped down to its core, it reveals itself as nothing more than a coping mechanism disguised as something sacred. This dependency gives peace to those who believes.

Peace or Truth
--------------

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1294/format:webp/1*R1FWq_-l0GrewGyVbQR3Ng.png)

This is something I resonate myself with deeply. Some time I feel frustrated why wouldn’t someone search for truth and at the same time I know the allure of `peace`.

> **Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.**
> 
> — [_A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right,_](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm) **_Karl Marx_**

Opium and religion both serve as temporary reliefs for suffering while obscuring the real causes of that suffering. Religion, like opium, provides comfort, but it prevents people from confronting and changing the conditions that oppress them. For Marx, the abolition of religion is part of a broader struggle to create a just and equitable society where people no longer need illusions to cope with their reality.

Fabrication of Divinity
-----------------------

> Iterations over time diluting the message obscuring the original.

In the movie Mr.Reed brings out the idea that holy texts that is revered nd followed blindly by millions are nothing but mythological hand downs over generations. What was fascinating to me was his claim that they ain’t the `truth` or `real` in any practical sense rather serves as conduits to some vague `ancient truth` .

One must worry then what’s the `ancient truth` is talked about here?

What I felt was these`truths`are primal, shared stories or ideas that resonated with humanity across cultures and eras. These truths are timeless and collective, yet they often get distorted or as mentioned in the movie commodified when institutionalised as `religion`.

The comfort of lies
-------------------

> Do you believe in god because somebody told you at an impressionable age that god is real despite having doubts as you got older, despite seeing evidence to the contrary your whole lives? …. or did you go on believing something you know isn’t true just to give you comfort because you were afraid of what it might mean if it was all a lie?

With this question Mr.reed cuts deep into the core of what belief truly represents for most people — a shield against the chaos and absurdity of reality, and the effect of this thoughtful question can be seen in the fear induced face of sister Barnes. The idea of god, religion got ingrained in us by our parents, society at an early age. Hence the idea of god doesn’t come from discovery of divine truth rather more about inheritance. But as we grow old the issues with this foundation becomes prominent where logic and evidence pulling us one way, fear and the need for meaning pulling the other. Yet, we cling to the familiar because the alternative — the vast emptiness of a godless universe — feels unbearable. It’s not about truth anymore; it’s about survival. Because admitting it’s a lie feels like tearing away a part of yourself — a part that whispers, _you’re not alone in this._

Faith as Fear’s Refuge
----------------------

Faith, as _Heretic_ explores, is more than just a tool for comfort — it’s deeply rooted in fear. Fear of the unknown, of death, and of meaninglessness. It’s this fear that keeps people clinging to belief systems, even when evidence suggests otherwise. Mr. Reed manipulates this fear with precision, showing how it operates both consciously and subconsciously. Belief becomes a refuge, a defense mechanism against confronting the terrifying idea that life might be random, purposeless, and utterly indifferent to our existence.

This fear isn’t just personal; it’s societal. Religion thrives because it capitalizes on these anxieties, offering simple answers to complex questions and giving people the illusion of control in a chaotic world.

Issues with Disbelief
---------------------

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*Wc8RpbXrK0lcOXSDpDwG2A.png)

Mr.Reed brings out issue with disbelief too. Without a divine or higher purpose life superficially becomes insignificant or should I say merely a collection of biological impulses. It strips away all illusions of significance, leaving us to confront the cold reality that we’re just here, and then we’re gone.

Absurdity of legacy
-------------------

> Can you imagine thousands of years from now people accepting Jar Jar as a significant religious figure?

Mr.Reed also brings out the point the way societies reframe history, how even the most ridiculous, seemingly inconsequential elements can be woven into the fabric of culture and belief. It’s a reminder that time distorts everything, turning trivial things into symbols, idols, or even the foundation of entire systems of thought.

Psychological Perspective on Faith
----------------------------------

Faith, as _Heretic_ shows, isn’t just about religion or culture — it’s a cornerstone of human psychology. It’s how we make sense of a world that often feels random and chaotic. It’s why faith is so stubbornly resilient, even when it stands on shaky ground, challenged by facts or reason. Belief systems aren’t just handed down to us; they’re wired into us because they serve a purpose: they help us cope.

### Cognitive Biases and the Grip of Faith

Here’s the thing about faith — it doesn’t just stick around because it feels good. It’s backed by our own minds playing tricks on us. Take **confirmation bias**, for example. It’s that little mental glitch that makes us focus on the evidence that supports what we already believe while ignoring the stuff that doesn’t. In religion, this looks like seeing every “answered” prayer as proof of divine power while explaining away unanswered ones as part of “God’s plan” or a test of character.

You know those moments when something just _clicks_ in your life, and it feels like fate? That’s confirmation bias in action — your brain cherry-picking data to back up the idea that something greater is at play. It’s comforting, sure, but it’s also a psychological safety net that keeps faith alive, even when the cracks start showing.

### Maslow’s Hierarchy: Faith as a Safety Net

If you think about it, faith ties in perfectly with **Maslow’s hierarchy of needs**. At the base of Maslow’s pyramid are the essentials: food, water, and safety. Faith plugs right into that second level — providing security. Believing that some omnipotent force has your back? It’s like wrapping yourself in an emotional blanket against life’s uncertainties.

But faith doesn’t just stop at security. As you move up the pyramid to things like belonging and purpose, faith steps up its game. It connects people through shared rituals, giving them a sense of community and meaning. And let’s be real — it’s a compelling story. It gives life structure, paints it with permanence, and makes the unpredictable feel a little less scary.

### Comfort vs. Truth: The Eternal Struggle

Here’s the psychological kicker: humans are wired to prioritize emotional stability over cold, hard facts. The universe doesn’t hand out purpose or meaning, and confronting that can feel like staring into an abyss. Faith swoops in with a lifeline, weaving narratives of hope and cosmic justice. It’s not about what’s real; it’s about what feels bearable.

In _Heretic_, you see this tension play out as characters cling to beliefs — not because they hold up to scrutiny, but because they make the harshness of reality a little softer. Faith is the easy answer, the soothing story we tell ourselves. But is it worth the cost?

Chasing the Butterfly: Transformation or Delusion?
--------------------------------------------------

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*FrK93Ab3CYY70ZNhzq7fpg.png)

The butterfly at the end of _Heretic_ lingers as one of the most poignant symbols. Butterflies often represent transformation, fleeting beauty, or rebirth, but in the context of the film, it raises deeper questions. Is the butterfly a sign of freedom, an affirmation of Sister Paxton’s faith? Or is it just a delusion, a product of her desperate, dying mind seeking meaning where there is none?

For me, the butterfly encapsulates the fragility of belief systems. Like the insect’s short life, faith can be beautiful but fleeting, a comforting illusion that crumbles under scrutiny. The movie doesn’t answer whether the butterfly is real or imagined, and that’s the brilliance of it — it leaves you to wrestle with what you want to believe.

Conclusion: Faith, Lies, and Humanity
-------------------------------------

_Heretic_ leaves you with a question that’s as unsettling as it is profound: **Is it better to live a comforting lie or face a painful truth?**

Faith, for all its flaws, offers something undeniable — peace. It gives people a framework to make sense of their lives, to feel connected, and to hold on to hope. But what happens when that peace comes at the expense of reality? _Heretic_ doesn’t sugarcoat it. Shedding faith isn’t portrayed as freeing; it’s raw and isolating. The characters who question their beliefs are left grappling with emptiness and existential dread. But isn’t there strength in that? In facing the world as it truly is?

The film challenges us to look inward. Are we brave enough to let go of comforting illusions for the sake of truth? Or is the weight of uncertainty too much to bear? The beauty of _Heretic_ is that it doesn’t hand you the answer — it leaves you suspended in the gray area, where faith and doubt collide. And maybe that’s the point: to make us wrestle with what it means to be human, to find meaning in the struggle itself.

I purposefully left a few things untouched like the part where Mr.reeds shows the illusion of choice but I could write about it a whole ass blog on this single topic so nahhh not in this one… It’s already 7:33 am and I started writing drafts for a few days so………HELL NAHHHH

Byeeeee….
