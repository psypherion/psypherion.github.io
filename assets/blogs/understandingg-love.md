So, there I was, mindlessly scrolling through Instagram like a mindless Instagram scroller does, when BAM! a reel about [love by Slavoj Zizek](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4ptjzjSvZD/) sucker-punched my existential dread right into the feels. (Don’t worry, it happens to the best of us.)

This wasn’t the first time love left me bewildered. Last year, I started a blog about it, but it devolved into a Frankenstein’s monster of ideas. Turns out, dissecting love with the precision of a brain surgeon might not be the most, well, romantic approach.

So, here’s the plan: a blog series dedicated to understanding love. Because hey, the only way to survive this cruel world filled with heart-wrenching sonnets and rom-com disappointments is to analyze the ever-loving heck out of it, right?

Love
----

The contemporary concept of love revolves around the experience of blissful infatuation with another person in most cases a bond between two people that includes physical attraction.

**The Ever-Shifting Landscape of Love**

In the bygone era of courtly love, knights jousted and sang serenades, hoping to win the favor of a noblewoman. Love was a performance, a game of elaborate gestures aimed at impressing a desired one. Today, the landscape has shifted dramatically. Arranged marriages have given way to casual flings and dating apps, reflecting a society where social norms and gender roles are constantly evolving.

**But amidst this ever-changing landscape, a fundamental question persists: what exactly are we seeking in love?** Is it the fleeting thrill of physical intimacy, the profound connection of deep emotional intimacy, or perhaps the selfless act of caring for another?

Some find solace in platonic love, cherishing the unwavering support and intellectual companionship of a dear friend. For others, love ignites through passionate expressions — a stolen glance, a gentle touch, a heart pounding with exhilaration. Love’s language extends far beyond the realm of romantic relationships. The Greeks, with their profound wisdom, categorized love into various forms:

*   **Philia (φιλία):** The warm affection and loyalty shared between friends and family.
*   **Eros (ἔρως):** The passionate desire and physical attraction that fuels romantic love.
*   **Agape (ἀγάπη):** The unconditional, selfless love often associated with religious beliefs.

**Beyond the Categories: Love’s Nuance**

These categories, however, are not rigid boxes. Eros, the passionate fire, can be channeled into a pursuit of knowledge or a creative endeavor, transforming its raw energy into something beautiful and productive. Agape, the unconditional love, doesn’t have to be solely reserved for religious contexts. It can manifest in acts of kindness extended to strangers, a compassion that transcends circumstance.

Philosophers like Aristotle and Carl Jung further explored the concept of love, recognizing that it encompasses more than just romantic desires. Love, in its truest form, is a multifaceted gem, reflecting a spectrum of emotions and experiences.

**The Erosion of the Sacred and the Rise of Serial Monogamy**

The concept of sacred marriage has been significantly eroded. Long-term commitments based on trust and responsibility seem to have been replaced by serial monogamy, or even polygamy. Yet, even amidst these changes, the human desire for love remains constant.

**Love’s Many Faces: Unpacking Desire**

But the question remains: what do we truly want? What kind of love are we seeking? Is it simply sex? Or is it the profound experience of deeply connecting with someone, the opportunity to care for another person? Some of us might be more inclined towards platonic love, cherishing the shared ideas and personal growth with someone we appreciate.

For others, love ignites through passionate expressions — cuddling, kissing, the physical closeness that stimulates our senses. The utterance of “I love you” can hold different meanings depending on the context — a casual expression between friends or a heartfelt declaration in a romantic relationship. Love can be communicated through words and actions between lovers. It can also manifest in a purely aesthetic appreciation, even towards inanimate objects.

**Beyond Philia: The Spectrum of Love**

While Philia, the love of friendship and shared experiences, forms a strong foundation for many relationships, the Greeks offered a richer tapestry of love.

### **Storge: The Natural Bond**

**Storge (στοργή)** represents a natural, familial love. It’s the inherent affection we feel towards parents, siblings, or even pets. This love transcends the conscious choice or shared interests that define Philia. It’s a primal bond rooted in biology and shared history.

**A Deeper Look at the Three Pillars**

Now, let’s revisit the three core Greek concepts of love with a nuanced perspective:

*   **Philia (φιλία):** This love thrives on mutual respect, shared interests, and a deep sense of camaraderie. It’s the love that binds us to close friends, chosen family, and those who enrich our lives through intellectual or emotional connection.
*   **Eros (ἔρως):** Passionate and all-consuming, Eros is fueled by intense desire and physical attraction. It’s the kind of love that ignites the early stages of romantic relationships, driving us to pursue and connect with the object of our affection.
*   **Agape (ἀγάπη):** This selfless, unconditional love prioritizes the well-being of others above our own. Often associated with religious beliefs, Agape extends beyond personal gain, seeking the good of another even in the face of hardship.

It’s important to understand that these categories aren’t rigid boxes. Love can be a complex interplay of all three elements. A friendship (Philia) might blossom into romantic love (Eros) over time, while a parental love (Storge) can evolve into a deeper, more selfless connection (Agape).

**Beyond the Greeks: Exploring Love’s Universality**

The Greeks weren’t the only ones to contemplate love’s multifaceted nature. Many cultures have unique concepts that paint a broader picture of this universal emotion. In future explorations, we can delve into these diverse perspectives, enriching our understanding of love in all its beautiful complexities.

**Eros Redefined: Kierkegaard and the Mystery of Regina Olsen**

The Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard’s relationship with Regina Olsen throws a fascinating light on the concept of Eros. While Eros is traditionally associated with intense physical attraction, Kierkegaard believed it could encompass a deeper yearning.

Kierkegaard met Regina when she was just fifteen and he was twenty-four. He was immediately captivated, but waited until she was older before expressing his feelings. Their relationship was unconventional. Though Kierkegaard wrote passionately about Regina and dedicated all his works to her, they never married.

Some scholars interpret this as Kierkegaard fearing the physical aspects of love, suggesting his Eros for Regina was purely intellectual or spiritual. Others believe he felt an overwhelming, almost mystical connection that transcended the need for physical intimacy.
**Beyond the Physical: The Many Faces of Eros**

Kierkegaard’s perspective challenges us to consider Eros beyond the realm of the purely physical. It suggests that Eros can manifest as an intense emotional yearning, a deep admiration, or an all-consuming desire for intellectual or spiritual connection with another person.

**Examples of Eros Beyond Physicality**

*   **A student’s passionate pursuit of knowledge in a particular field.**
*   **An artist’s deep connection to and inspiration from a particular muse.**
*   **A spiritual devotee’s unwavering love for a deity.**

Someone with a deep love for physics or philosophy experiences a form of Eros. This intense fervor can be channeled into something more sophisticated and productive, rather than just physical gratification. Carl Jung echoed this sentiment, arguing that libido, the life force or creative energy, isn’t solely limited to sexual desires.

**The Power of Imagination**

Kierkegaard’s case also highlights the power of imagination in fueling Eros. His intense feelings for Regina may have been fueled by the image he created of her, rather than solely by physical attraction. This underscores the role of our own desires and perceptions in shaping our experience of love.

**Agape: Unconditional Love and its Challenges**

The concept of Agape, often associated with Christianity, represents a love for God and others that is unconditional. It focuses on the needs of others, as opposed to Philia and Eros, and doesn’t require reciprocation. This form of love, however, can border on self-sacrifice, potentially lacking the passionate spark that ignites some relationships.

**Agape vs. Salos: Universality and Self-Preservation**

On the other end of the spectrum lies **Salos (σάλος)**, a love that is excessive and self-destructive. It prioritizes immediate gratification over long-term well-being. Agape, in contrast, represents a more balanced approach, a universal love that transcends all circumstances.

**The Paradox of Agape: Blessings and Shortcomings**

Agape offers the blessing of a love free from attachments. It’s a love that is unconditionally given, accepting any action of others. However, this very characteristic raises a concern: the absence of passion. A purely Agape-based love might lack the excitement and intensity that some crave. While it offers the potential for tranquility and lasting joy, it might lack the thrilling highs and lows of passionate love.

**Media’s Misrepresentation: The Allure of the Chase**

The media often glorifies a narrow version of love — a whirlwind romance with an intense chase leading to a happily-ever-after. This relentless portrayal can make us feel inadequate or lost if our own experiences don’t conform to this idealized image.

**Love’s Enduring Mystery: A Journey Through Connection**

Despite its complexities and challenges, the human spirit remains drawn to love’s magnetic pull. It’s the invisible thread that weaves us together, a source of boundless joy, unwavering support, and profound personal growth. As we embark on this exploration of love, let’s embrace its beautiful messiness in all its forms. Within its depths lies the potential for a life enriched by connection, compassion, and a deeper sense of purpose.

In our next exploration, we’ll delve into the diverse tapestries of love woven by different cultures. Perhaps by examining these unique perspectives, we can shed light on how societal norms subtly influence the way we experience and express this complex emotion.

One particularly insightful exploration of love comes from a surprising source: the acclaimed show “Fleabag.” The priest’s iconic speech, famously beginning with “Love is awful…” offers a refreshingly honest perspective. Perhaps we can utilize this raw portrayal as a springboard to explore the concept of love a bit more.
